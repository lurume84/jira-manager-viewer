# Jirafy viewer
Jirafy is a time tracker for JIRA Agile that mimics Spotify's frontend:

* Songs are Tasks
* Albums are User Stories
* Artists are Assignees
* Music player is the Time Tracker
* Song Popularity is Task progress

Work needs to be commited but tasks are automatically assigned to user when a task is started.

It is recommended to use [Jirafy Desktop](https://github.com/lurume84/jirafy-desktop) for a better user experience.

# Motivation
Applications based on frontend-backend can transgress its expected lifetime. This is an experiment of a complete frontend reutilization thanks to HTML and REST APIs. A reinterpretation of Spotify concepts leads to a new application purpose.
